### multiple assigment = allows us to assign many vars at the same time in 1 line


# single assigment example:

# name = "joe"
# age = 21
# attractive = True
# print(name)
# print(age)
# print(attractive)


# multiple assigment:

# name, age, attractive = "Joe", 21, True
# print(name)
# print(age)
# print(attractive)


# 2nd example:

# Spongebob = Patrick = Sandy = Squidward = 30

# print(Spongebob)
# print(Patrick)
# print(Sandy)
# print(Squidward)
